**Omachy** turns a barebones Arch Linux install into a **fully configured, visually polished, and modern web development workstation** powered by **Hyprland** with just a single command.

Inspired by [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) by Basecamp, Omachy is tailored to my own workflow, development stack, and design preferences.
